#### Features
1. **Directory Guards (`dir:`)**
2. **Port Guards**
For example port 443 is only subject to https connections, require override to ensure it happens even in the binary so that it can return an error if the `.toml` file has been misconfigured or changed maliciously.
3. **rwx ( `perm:`) Guards** 
These check for Create, Read, Write, Append, Modify, Delete permissions
